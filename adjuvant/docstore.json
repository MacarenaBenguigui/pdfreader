Adults with resected (R0) \nstage II or III esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer who had received \nneoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and had residual pathological disease were ran -\ndomly assigned in a 2:1 ratio to receive nivolumab (at a dose of 240 mg every 2 weeks \nfor 16 weeks, followed by nivolumab at a dose of 480 mg every 4 weeks) or match -\ning placebo. The maximum duration of the trial intervention period was 1 year. \nThe primary end point was disease-free survival.\nRESULTS\nThe median follow-up was 24.4 months. Among the 532 patients who received \nnivolumab, the median disease-free survival was 22.4 months (95% confidence \ninterval [CI], 16.6 to 34.0), as compared with 11.0 months (95% CI, 8.3 to 14.3) \namong the 262 patients who received placebo (hazard ratio for disease recurrence \nor death, 0.69; 96.4% CI, 0.56 to 0.86; P<0.001). Disease-free survival favored \nnivolumab across multiple prespecified subgroups. Grade 3 or 4 adverse events \nthat were considered by the investigators to be related to the active drug or pla -\ncebo occurred in 71 of 532 patients (13%) in the nivolumab group and 15 of 260 \npatients (6%) in the placebo group. The trial regimen was discontinued because of \nadverse events related to the active drug or placebo in 9% of the patients in the \nnivolumab group and 3% of those in the placebo group.\nCONCLUSIONS\nAmong patients with resected esophageal or gastroesophageal junction cancer \nwho had received neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, disease-free survival was sig -\nnificantly longer among those who received nivolumab adjuvant therapy than \namong those who received placebo.

Instead, the standard of \ncare after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and \nsurgery is surveillance.4,5\nIn clinical trials involving patients who had \npreviously treated, advanced gastroesophageal \ncancers with the histologic type adenocarcino -\nma or squamous-cell carcinoma, survival among \nthose who received nivolumab, a fully human \nmonoclonal anti\u2013programmed death 1 (PD-1) \nantibody, was longer than among those who \nreceived either placebo or chemotherapy.12,13 Here, \nwe report the results of CheckMate 577, a global, \nrandomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled \nphase 3 trial that evaluated a novel approach of \nusing a checkpoint inhibitor as adjuvant treat -\nment after neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and \nsurgery for esophageal or gastroesophageal \njunction cancer.\nMethods\nPatients\nWe enrolled patients who were at least 18 years \nof age, had resected esophageal or gastroesoph -\nageal junction cancer, and had received neoad -\njuvant chemoradiotherapy.

Recurrence was defined as the appear -\nance of one or more new lesions (local, regional, \nor distant in location from the primary resected site, confirmed by imaging or by cytologic or \npathological evaluation) as assessed by the in -\nvestigators. The secondary end points were over -\nall survival and survival at 1, 2, and 3 years. \nExploratory end points included safety, distant \nmetastasis\u2013free survival, and patient-reported \noutcomes (evaluated with the Functional Assess -\nment of Cancer Therapy\u2013Esophageal [FACT-E] \nscale and the three-level version of the European \nQuality of Life\u20135 Dimensions questionnaire \n[EQ-5D-3L]).

If a new lesion was equivocal or \nunclear, either because of the lesion size or an \nambiguous cause, the suspected lesion was con -\nfirmed by means of cytologic or histopathologic \nassessment or by a follow-up imaging evaluation \nwithin 4 weeks (if biopsy was not possible). If \ncytologic or histopathologic assessment or re -\npeat imaging confirmed recurrence, then recur -\nrence was recorded according to the date of the \ninitial imaging.

Furthermore, \ngiven that adenocarcinoma is the most common \nhistologic type of gastroesophageal junction \ncancer, it is notable that the hazard ratio (0.75) \nin the adenocarcinoma subgroup (regardless of \ntumor location) was intermediate between the \nhazard ratios for esophageal cancer (0.61) and \ngastroesophageal junction cancer (0.87), and \namong patients with adenocarcinoma, the me -\ndian disease-free survival was 8.3 months longer \nwith nivolumab than with placebo.\nIn patients who received nivolumab, the mag -\nnitude of benefit with respect to disease-free \nsurvival was greater in those in whom nivolum -\nab was initiated at least 10 weeks after surgery \nthan in those in whom nivolumab was initiated \nless than 10 weeks after surgery. This finding \nsuggests that a prolonged recovery may be needed \nafter intensive preoperative therapy followed by \nsurgery, especially esophagectomy.17,18 However, \nboth patient subgroups stratified according to \ntime from complete resection to randomization \nhad an approximately 10-month-longer median \ndisease-free survival with nivolumab than with \nplacebo, and no clear imbalances in baseline \ncharacteristics associated with an increased risk \nof recurrence were identified in these two sub -\ngroups.\nIn addition to a disease-free survival benefit, \nthe risk of distant recurrence or death was 26% \nlower and distant metastasis\u2013free survival was \n10.7 months longer with adjuvant nivolumab \nthan with placebo. Our trial is ongoing, and an \nanalysis of the secondary end point of overall \nsurvival is planned.\nWith the positive results of our CheckMate \n577 trial, esophageal or gastroesophageal junc -\ntion cancer is the second tumor type, after \nmelanoma, for which nivolumab has provided a \nbenefit as adjuvant treatment.19 There are limited \ndata to compare the results of neoadjuvant \nchemoradiotherapy with the results of periopera -\ntive chemotherapy (a standard treatment option \nfor resectable esophageal, gastroesophageal junc -\ntion, and gastric adenocarcinomas). The recent \nGerman FLOT4-AIO trial of perioperative che -\nmotherapy did not include patients with esopha -geal cancer,20 and the results cannot be directly \ncompared with those of our CheckMate 577 trial \nof adjuvant therapy. Data are lacking to deter -\nmine whether the results of perioperative che -\nmotherapy could be improved by adding check -\npoint inhibitors.\nThe safety profile of adjuvant nivolumab was \nin line with that in previous trials involving pa -\ntients with gastroesophageal and other solid \ntumors.12,13,19,21,22 Serious adverse events related \nto nivolumab and adverse events leading to dis -\ncontinuation of the trial regimen in the nivolum -\nab group were reported in less than 10% of the \npatients. Most of the patients in the adjuvant \nnivolumab group (86%) received at least 90% of \nthe planned dose.\nIn patients with resected esophageal or gas -\ntroesophageal junction cancer after neoadjuvant \nchemoradiotherapy, nivolumab adjuvant therapy \nwas associated with a significantly longer dis -\nease-free survival than placebo.
